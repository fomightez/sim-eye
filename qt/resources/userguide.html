<h1>User Guide</h1>
<h2 id = introduction>Introduction</h2>
<h3>Aim</h3>
<p>Gore Sim Eye is designed to take a fundus image, and produce a net which when printed, 
may be used to construct a simulation eye (or <strong>sim eye</strong>) suitable for teaching and learning in ophthalmology.
The net is constructed of several petal-shaped sections known as <em>gores</em>, which may be 
conveniently joined to make an approximation of a spherical eye.
</p>
<h3>Use</h3>
<p>
The user selects a fundus image file. This image should be square (or very nearly square) and centred, and the fundus
should be tight against the edge of the image. Common image formats such as JPEG and PNG are supported.
The user must enter the angular extent of the fundus image. There are various options to control the 
gore net that is produced, e.g. the number of gores to use. The resulting gores may then be calculated
and displayed, and finally saved as an image (again, in one of several common formats). This image may
then be printed, cut out and assembled to form a sim eye.
</p>
<h3>Approach</h3>
<p>
The process involves two stages:
</p>
<ol>
<li>the positions of pixels in the fundus image are transformed into corresponding positions in the eye, using
a simplified optical model, to produce a "map" of the eye based on the input image;
</li>
<li>
this map is projected into a series of gores using a standard map-making projection, and the gores are stitched
together into a final image.
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Intended use and limitations</h2>
<p>TBD</p>
<h2>Using this tool</h2>
<h3>Open an image</h3>
<p>
From the <em>File</em> menu, select <em>Open input image</em>, or click the Open icon on the toolbar.
This will open the file dialog: simply select your chosen fundus image and click OK. The image should 
be square (or very nearly square) and centred, and the fundus should be tight against the edge of the image. 
Common image formats such as JPEG and PNG are supported.
</p>
<h3>Settings</h3>
<p>
Adjust the settings using the controls in the main window. These are as follows (note that hovering over
any control/icon will display a help "tooltip").
<ul>
<li><h4>Image extent</h4>Angular size of the input image, in degrees, measured from edge to edge 
(i.e. a fundus image that covered the half-sphere would have an extent of 180 degrees).</li>
<li><h4>Number of gores</h4>Number of gores to produce: a higher number will approximate a sphere better,
but may be more difficult to assemble.</li>
<li><h4>Retinal size</h4>Desired angular extent of the gores. Selecting 360 degrees will produce gores that
make an entire sphere.</li>
<li><h4>No-cut area</h4>Controls the angular size of the region in the centre of the gores where the gores are
joined together (i.e. there are no cuts in this region). Selecting a bigger angle may make cutting more straightforward,
but may also result in a slightly flattened region at the centre.</li>
<li><h4>Rotation</h4>Degrees by which to rotate the fundus with respect to the petals. Rotation is specified as 
counter-clockwise: use negative degrees to rotate clockwise. This option is useful, for example, for
ensuring that interesting parts of the image do not fall on or near the cut edges of a gore.</li>
<li><h4>Quality</h4>Percentage of original image resolution: 100% corresponds to the maximum original image resolution.
Using a lower quality setting will make calculation faster, but results in lower-resolution images. This option is
useful for testing options.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Background colour</h4>
Set the background colour by selecting <em>Choose background colour</em> from the <em>File</em> menu, or 
clicking the background colour icon on the toolbar. 
<h3>Gore!</h3>
<p>
Click the <em>Gore</em> button to process the image and produce the gores. The status bar will display the current 
stage of the calculation as it progresses. Once complete, the output is displayed in the preview window.  To cancel 
the calculation, click the cancel button (you may have to wait a moment for the current stage to complete 
before the calculation is cancelled).
</p>
<h3>Save the image</h3>
<p>
Select <em>Save as</em> from the <em>File</em> menu (or click on the Save As icon on the toolbar) to choose a 
file name and location for saving the resulting gore image. To select the image format for the saved image, 
simply choose and enter the appropriate file extension,  e.g. .jpg for JPEG, .png for PNG etc. The <em>Save</em>
option will save the current output image using the current filename.
</p>
<h3>Close and Exit</h3>
<p>
Close the current image by selecting <em>Close</em> from the <em>File</em> menu, or by clicking the Close icon
on the toolbar. Exit the application by selecting <em>Exit</em> from the <em>File</em> menu, or by clicking the Exit icon
on the toolbar.
