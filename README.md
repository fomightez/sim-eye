# sim-eye
A project for producing low-cost, easily-assembled simulation eyes for use in ophthalmology training.

Note: the underlying model, the algorithm and the provided implementation are all being actively developed and have yet to be peer reviewed. They are provided here purely for information.

## Open a simple interface to produce gores from example images or by uploading image files
